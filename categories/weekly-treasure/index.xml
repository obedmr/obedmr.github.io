      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while that I promised I&amp;rsquo;d submit a daily bible treasure. This is a time
for new resolutions and to make it happen. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to share some extracts from my
daily bible reading. I trying my best to post something at least once a week. I wish that
The Lord bless you with all this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
