      <description>This time I have the opportunity to share some of the lessons learned on my career. I went to Zacatecas city for the 2017 CISOL which is an Open Source conference that gathers students and professionals from all the country for sharing Open Source related projects.
Iâ€™ve been invited to this event since 2 years ago, on last conferences I usually shared very technical talks about Open Source cloud project like OpenStack, CIAO and Docker.</description>

      <description>As member of the OpenStack GDL community this was the first time I present a topic there.
I talked about the Containers trending technologies and they&amp;rsquo;re affecting the Cloud ecosystem, in this case OpenStack. How OpenStack is driving the efforts for delivering Container as a Service and also deployment of OpenStack on top of Containers.

      <title>Golang, Python or C/C&#43;&#43;, who wins?</title>
      <link>http://example.org/tech/en/golang-python-c-who-wins/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/tech/en/golang-python-c-who-wins/</guid>
      <description>This time I had an opportunity for presenting at Ameca, Jalisco. I presented at the CUVALLES university.
My talk was about some of the key features of Golang, Python and C/C++ programming languages. But, this was not the main reason I choose this topic. The idea is to explain the process for choosing a good programming language for your project. It&amp;rsquo;s not about the language, it&amp;rsquo;s about the problem you want to solve and which are the features a programming language can offer you to solve the problem.</description>
