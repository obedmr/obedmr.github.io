    "body": "We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come tre prasies of the Lord, An His strength and His wonderful works that He has done. Psalm 78:4\nThis week I want to share some of the learnings that I got from reading God\u0026rsquo;s word. And this is about how God gives instructions on sharing His wonderful works to the next generation to make sure they don\u0026rsquo;t forget how great He is and why we worship, obey and follow Him.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that God continues speaking to His people. On my daily devotional reading I found something that catched my attention and made me think how God has instructed his people the importance of keeping His Word and Works in our hearts and in those who will come after us.\nIn Psalm 78, Asaph is doing a contemplation about God\u0026rsquo;s instructions and how Israel people should make sure that new generations were aware of God\u0026rsquo;s wonderful works and how God did it on Israel\u0026rsquo;s liberation from Egypt.\nBut why, why new generations should keep on their hearts all God\u0026rsquo;s power?. This is an interesting question that is revealed in the 78th Psalm. First, it was a commandment from God (Psalm 78:5-7). Second, new generations should set their hope in God and don\u0026rsquo;t forget His works. As part of this constant reinforcement, a proper and good consequence would come; new generation would be loyal and faithful to God. It reminds me what is being said by God\u0026rsquo;s word in Proverbs:\nTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. Proverbs 3:5-8 (KJV)\nToday, this keeps being a reminder to us that we need to make sure that our new generations are aware of God\u0026rsquo;s works. He continues being the same Powerful and Wonderful God. We need to proclame it everywhere we have influence (home, school, family, work, community, everywhere).\nGod establishes principles for an abundant life, it\u0026rsquo;s our choice to follow or to ignore them. There are tremendous blessings on God\u0026rsquo;s grace if we choose to follow Him. Many men and women experienced God\u0026rsquo;s grace when they decided God as first.\nNo matter how difficult, evolving and constant troubled world we are, let\u0026rsquo;s decide for Him an proclame His grace and love. We will not hide God\u0026rsquo;s works and grace.\nSome God\u0026rsquo;s men that decided to proclame and keep God\u0026rsquo;s word:\n Noah - Genesis 7 Joshua - Joshua 24:15 David - Psalm 78:70-72 Daniel - Daniel 1:8 ",

    "body": "It has been a while that I promised I\u0026rsquo;d submit a daily bible treasure. This is a time for new resolutions and to make it happen. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to share some extracts from my daily bible reading. I trying my best to post something at least once a week. I wish that The Lord bless you with all this.\nThese is part of my every year plan, reading the full Bible from Genesis to Apocalypse. This 2019 year I\u0026rsquo;m reading the NKJV Chronological Study Bible. Publishers and authors did a great job in terms of arranging some order of Bible stories in time. They\u0026rsquo;re careful and advertise readers that there\u0026rsquo;s no plan of modifying neither giving a final and definitive order of events. They\u0026rsquo;re basically trying give some historical background to Bible\u0026rsquo;s readers.\nToday I was reading about Moses and his encounter with God in the Horeb mountain. God starts his calling through a burning bush - Exodus 3\nIn chaper 4, God starts giving a life changing call to Moses, something that would change the course of the Israel nation\u0026rsquo;s history. A big deal for someone that had been out of Egypt for around 40 years.\nAnd, what was Moses\u0026rsquo;s response to that God\u0026rsquo;s calling:\n\u0026quot;\u0026hellip;O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I am slow of speech and [b]slow of tongue.” - Exodus 4:10\nGod says:\n\u0026quot;\u0026hellip;Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the Lord?.. - Exodus 4:11\nGod has the power to make it happen, when God says something, He will keep his promise. Our creator is in our side, we cannot fear what ever comes if He\u0026rsquo;s with us. God was calling Moses, it meant that there was not doubt that God would be with him wherever he\u0026rsquo;d go and he did it. God did great things through his loyal servant.\nNext time you feel like you cannot do it or you\u0026rsquo;re thinking that you\u0026rsquo;re not made for that; remember, if God has called you and you\u0026rsquo;re walking on his purpose, there\u0026rsquo;s not space for failure there, God will do it as He promised. Just keep your faith in the Lord and He will do it.\nGod is your Creator, he knows everything about you, when He gives you a new comission, He will be there and will make sure that your needs are provided on His perfect time.\n",
